      <h2>Brain Assymetries in the Superior Temporal Sulcus</h2>

        <p>  At Brigham Young University, I worked for about two years as a research assistant
      for Dr. Jared Nielsen trying to find whether assymetries in the
      brain have any influence on language development in children.</p>

      <h2>Worst Case Scenario</h2>

        <p> In my design studies, I was
        part of a team that created an app interface for emergency
        preparedness and critical emergency response. We built it to give
        response instruction for anyone wanting to prepare for emergencies
        as well as rapid and dependable instruction for critical emergencies
        when first responders have not yet arrived.</p>

        <h2>Emergency Preparedness 101</h2>

        <p> Shortly after I worked on Worst Case Scenario, I began working with a
        non-profit called the Disaster Discovery Center. Our team was asked to design a travelling
        exhibit the DDC could take to schools and universities to teach
        disaster response and preparedness. I was part of a smaller team
        tasked with designing a web interface with which students would
        interact to proceed through the physical environment. This interface
        would prompt the students with disaster situations that would
        test their personal preparedness and their knowledge of survival
        scenarios.</p>
