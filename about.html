      <h2>About</h2>

      <p>I was born in a little town in Oklahoma and have always been
      a deeply creative person. I love writing, reading, storytelling,
      and problem solving. It wasn't until college when I learned that
      I'm interested in using research to fuel and guide my creativity.</p>
