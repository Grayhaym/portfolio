    <h2>About</h2>

    <p>I was born in a little town in Oklahoma and have always been
    a deeply creative person. I love writing, reading, storytelling,
    and problem solving. It wasn't until college when I learned that
    I'm interested in using research to fuel and guide my creativity.</p>

    <h2>Projects</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><h3>Brain Assymetries in the Superior Temporal Sulcus</h3><br/>At Brigham Young
      University, I worked for about two years as a research assistant
      for Dr. Jared Nielsen trying to find whether assymetries in the
      brain have any influence on language development in children.</li>
      <li><h3>Worst Case Scenario</h3><br/>In my design studies, I was
      part of a team that created an app interface for emergency
      preparedness and critical emergency response. We built it to give
      response instruction for anyone wanting to prepare for emergencies
      as well as rapid and dependable instruction for critical emergencies
      when first responders have not yet arrived. </li>
      <li><h3>Emergency Preparedness 101</h3><br/>Shortly after I worked
      on Worst Case Scenario, I began working with a non-profit called the
      Disaster Discovery Center. Our team was asked to design a travelling
      exhibit the DDC could take to schools and universities to teach
      disaster response and preparedness. I was part of a smaller team
      tasked with designing a web interface with which students would
      interact to proceed through the physical environment. This interface
      would prompt the students with disaster situations that would
      test their personal preparedness and their knowledge of survival
      scenarios.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><h3>Neuroscience Research Assistant</h3><br/>In Dr. Nielsen's
      lab, I worked on a couple different projects for papers, both
      involving brain asymmetries and the roles they potentially play in
      development through childhood and adolescence.</li>
      <li><h3>Psychiatric Technician</h3><br/>For a time, I worked in the
      Utah State Hospital as a technician working directly with patients.
      These were patients of all ages and with a wide variety of mental
      illnesses. While I'm no longer working towards a career in mental
      health, I pride myself on keen social senses and conflict resolution
      skills.</li>
